# Introduction to Machine Learning

This is a collection of python notebooks discussing the introductory concepts in machine learning.
These are done as a part of my learning processes, course assignments etc. I will be updating 
the repository with new topics once I cover them. Some of the topics covered so far include:

* Exploratory data analysis
* Linear algebra
* k-Nearest Neighbors classifier
* Hidden Markov Model
* Linear regression
* Naive-Bayes Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Probability and statistics
